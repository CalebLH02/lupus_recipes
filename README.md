Hello everyone! This is my first official project utilizing HTML and CSS. Courtesy of the Odin Project, i've been able to learn the necessary tools and knowledge to put together a basic website. To anyone seeing this that happens to have lupus, hopefully this website can provide some recipes that will help. I plan to revisit this project at a later date when I have more honed HTML and CSS skills.

Bye!
